        <li>Running </li>
          <p>
            I started running as an extra-curricuar in highschool and now do it
            more as a hobby to help stay in shape and pass the
          </p>
        <li>Gaming </li>
          <p>
            Gaming has alwats been a fun pastime for me and I can enjoy both
            online gaming as well as some in person board games.
          </p>
        <li>Ultimate Frisbee </li>
          <p>
            Playing Ultimate Frisbee is just a great activity if you can gather
            enough people because even people that aren't good at frisbee have
            still had fun playing it.
          </p>
        <li>Disc Golfing </li>
          <p>
            I wish I could go disc golfing more often but I don't currently have
            a set of discs and have relied on friends in the past to go. However
            it is always fun even if im not the best.
          </p>
        <li>Baseball </li>
          <p>
            I got into baseball when I was really young and playing on teams all
            the way up into highschool before I stopped but will still
            occasionaly play a small game with friends.
